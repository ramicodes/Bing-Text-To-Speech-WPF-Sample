# Customize Voice Output with Azure Speech Services
 This repo contains a sample application made with C# and WPF for using Text-to-Speech API from the Azure speech services, one of the Microsoft Cognitive Services, formerly known as Project Oxford. 

The sample includes input parameters to allow customization to the voice output via SSML tags. You can enter values for the speaking rate, pitch, contour and volume.
